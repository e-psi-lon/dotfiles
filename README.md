# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

# Credits

- I would like to thank [Rignchen](https://gitlab.com/Rignchen) for his [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/Rignchen/dotfile) from which I took a lot of inspiration (and some copy-pasted code).
- [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) for the awesome prompt. I use a custom theme based on the [Rignchen's theme](https://gitlab.com/Rignchen/dotfile/-/blob/main/.config/oh-my-posh/theme.toml) which is itself based on the Mojada pre-installed theme.
